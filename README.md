# Module_7_Challenge

Building a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python and Viola library to analyze the performance of a fintech ETF. 

First, we are analyzing a single asset in the ETF by using the SELECT statement to read all the PYPL data from the database. 
Plot a hvPlot to create a visualization for the PYPL daily return. 
Using advanced SQL queries to optimize efficiency of accessing data by using the SELECT statement where the closing price was higher than 200.0 
Finding the top 10 daily returns of PYPL by using the SELECT, ORDER, LIMIT functions
At the end, reading the data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame 

Analyzing the entire ETF portfolio by joining the tables into a single DataFrame using the GDOT.time syntax 
Using the average daily returns to calculate the annualized returns for the portfolio. 
using the average daily returns to calculate the cumulative returns of the ETF portfolio
Plotting a hvPlot to create a line plot

Using Viola to deploy notebook as a web applications:
